<!--Place the jetty-web.xml into your web applicationâ€™s WEB-INF folder. When Jetty deploys a web application,
it looks for a file called WEB-INF/jetty-web.xml or WEB-INF/web-jetty.xml within the web application (or WAR)
and applies the configuration found there. Be aware that jetty-web.xml is called after all other configuration
has been applied to the web application.-->
